# CSC111 Project: Destiny (Social and Dating App Prototype)
This is our course project for CSC111 (Winter 2025). Users can make social and romantic connections with others by completing their profiles in the GUI. We utilized a decision tree-based recommendation system to match users according to their attributes. User connections are shown in graph networks.

## How to run the program
- Download all .py files and destiny_home_page.png
- Install the necessary modules as listed in requirements.txt
- Run main.py
- Enter any name and complete your profile (Enter "admin" to view connection graphs)
